A lounge chair , recliner ,or bed (propped up with pillows) is ideal. Inspection 5. Check the expiry date on the syringe. Do not use if the date has passed. 6. Check the syringe is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear solution without particles. If the syringe is damaged or the medicine is not clear , use another syringe. Injection site 7. Choose an area on the right or left side of your stomach. This should be at least 5 centimetres away from your belly button and out towards your sides. 8. Change the place where you inject between the left and right sides of your stomach, depending on the area you were last injected. This is to prevent scarring which will make it harder to inject the area and also affect how the medication is released into your body . Avoid injecting on scars and bruises. Injection technique 9. Cleanse (do not rub) the selected site for injection with an alcohol swab. 10. Remove the protective cap off the needle, do not allow the needle to touch anything to make sure it stays clean. 11. Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, gently pinch the cleaned area of your abdomen between your forefinger and thumb to make a fold in the skin. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. 12. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing downwards (vertically at 90 degree angle) and inject a full length needle into the skin fold. Inject at 45° angle for needle length ≥8 mm or if the patient is thin. 13. Press down plunger with your finger (thumb). Complete the injection using all of the medicine in the syringe. Hold for 10 seconds. 14. Remove the needle by pulling it straight out. Let go of the skin fold. 15. To avoid bruising, do not rub the injection site. 16.

Evolocumab is administered under the skin (subcutaneously), every 2 weeks or 1 time each month. 2. 420mg dose can be administered by giving 3 injections consecutively within 30 minutes at different injection sites. Preparation 1. Remove the pre-filled pen from the original package carefully . Return the original package with unused pre-filled pen to the refrigerator . 2. Wait for at least 30 minutes for the pre-filled pen to reach room temperature before injecting. This will minimise pain at the injection site. Do not warm or expose to direct sunlight to warm the pre-filled pen. 3. Do not shake the pre-filled pen. Inspection 4. Check the solution in the window . It should be clear and colourless to slightly yellow . 5. Do not use if ● The solution is cloudy or discoloured or contains large lumps. ● Any part of the pre-filled pen appears cracked or broken. ● If the pre-filled pen has been dropped. ● The orange cap is missing or not securely attached. ● The expiration date has passed. Injection Site 6. Only inject at these injection sites: ● Thigh ● Abdomen, except 2 inches (5 cm) area around belly button. ● Outer area of upper arm (not for self-injection). 7. Rotate injection site. If you need to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the site you used in the previous injection. 8. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender , 152 bruised, red or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. 9. Do not co-administer with other injectable drugs at the same administration site. Injection Technique 10. Clean the injection site with alcohol wipe. Let the skin dry before injection. Do not touch this area again before injecting. 11. Pull the orange cap straight off. ● Do not twist, bend or wiggle the orange cap. ● Do not put the orange cap back onto the pre-filled pen. ● Do not leave the orange cap off for more than 5 minutes as this can dry out the medicine. 12. It is normal to see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle or yellow safety guard. Do not put fingers into the yellow safety guard. 13. Create a firm surface at the selected injection site by using either stretch method or pinch method. ● Stretch method: stretch the skin firmly by moving your thumb and fingers in the opposite direction, creating an area about 2 inches (5 cm) wide. ● Pinch method: pinch the skin firmly between your thumb and fingers, creating an area about 2 inches (5 cm) wide. It is important to keep skin stretched or pinched while injecting. 14. Keep holding the stretched or pinched skin. With the orange cap off, put the yellow safety guard on your skin at 90 degrees. The needle is inside the yellow safety guard. Do not touch the grey button yet. 15. Firmly push down the pre-filled pen onto the skin until it stops moving. 16. When you are ready to inject, press the grey start button. You will hear a click. 17. Keep pushing down on the skin. Window on the pre-filled pen turns from clear to yellow when the injection is done. You may hear a second click. Your injection could take about 15 seconds. 18. Lift your thumb while still holding the pre-filled pen on your skin. 19. Remove the pre-filled pen from your skin. The needle will be automatically covered. Do not recap the pre-filled pen or put fingers into yellow safety guard. 20. Discard the used pre-filled pen and orange cap in a hard, puncture-proof disposal container . 21. If there is blood at injection site, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site. Apply a plaster if needed. Missed dose management 1. If a dose is missed and administer within 7 days from the missed dose, you can resume the original schedule. 2. If a 2-weekly dose is not administered within 7 days, wait until the next dose of the original schedule and inject. 3. If a monthly dose is not administered within 7 days, administer the dose and start a new schedule based on the new injection date.

Prior to injection, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water . Towel dry. 2. Sit in a comfortable position so you can easily see the area of their stomach where you will be injecting. A lounge chair , recliner , or bed (propped up with pillows) is ideal. Inspection 1. Check the expiry date on the syringe. Do not use it if the date has passed. 2. Check the syringe is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear solution without particles. If the syringe is damaged or the medicine is not clear , use another syringe. 3. Do not expel any air from the syringe before administering the injection. You may lose some of the medicine if you do. 170 Injection Site 1. Only inject at these injection sites: ● Thigh ● Abdomen, except 2 inches (5 cm) area around belly button. ● Outer area of upper arm (not for self-injection). 2. Choose an area on the right or left side of your stomach. This should be at least 5 centimetres away from your belly button and out towards your sides. 3. Rotate injection site. Change the place where you inject between the left and right sides of your stomach, depending on the area you were last injected. This is to prevent scarring which will make it harder to inject the area and also affect how the medication is released into your body . Avoid injecting on scars and bruises. 4. Do not co-administer with other injectable drugs at the same administration site. Injection Technique 1. Clean (do not rub) the injection site with alcohol wipe. Let the skin dry before injection. Do not touch this area again before injecting. 2. Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, gently pinch the cleaned area of your abdomen between your forefinger and thumb to make a fold in the skin. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection 3. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing downwards (vertically at 90 degree angle) and inject a full length needle into the skin fold. Inject at 45° angle for needle length ≥8 mm or if the patient is thin. 4. Press down plunger with your finger (thumb). Complete the injection using all of the medicine in the syringe. Hold for 10 seconds. 5. Release the plunger and the needle will withdraw automatically from the skin and retract into the security sleeve where it will be locked permanently . Let go of the skin fold. 6. To avoid bruising, do not rub the injection site. 7. Drop the used syringe into a hard, puncture-proof container . Close the container lid tightly and place the container out of reach of children. 8. When the container is full, dispose of it safely . 9. If there is blood at the injection site, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site. Apply a plaster if needed. 10. Do not stop taking your medication unless advised to do so by your prescriber . Missed dose management If you forget to take a dose, inject it as soon as you remember . Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose Do not stop taking your medication unless advised to do so by your prescriber",

    dosage: "See indication for dosage details",
    methodOfAdministration: "1. Gently roll refrigerated insulin between the palms 10 times to warm the insulin. 2. Pull off the pen cap. 3. Inserting a new cartridge (Only for non-prefilled insulin pen): i. Detach the cartridge holder by twisting & pulling gently away from the pen with a click. ii. Reset the plunger rod by pushing the plunger rod gently back into the pen body . 204 iii. Insert the insulin cartridge into the cartridge holder of the insulin pen and screw the cartridge holder to the pen body tightly . 4. Mixing / Resuspending the insulin pen (only for cloudy insulin eg NPH, and premixed insulin). i. Gently tip cloudy insulin up and down for 10 cycles or until uniformly cloudy . Vigorous shaking should be avoided since this produces bubbles which reduce dose accuracy ii. Visually check for milky white appearance. ● Inadequate resuspension of cloudy insulin before injection may lead to varying concentrations of medication dosage that can cause unpredictable clinical responses 5. Fix the needle to the insulin pen. i. Remove the paper tab of a new needle, screw the needle to the pen and remove the inner and outer cap (do not keep the inner cap). ● Shorter needles (4, 5, 6 mm) provide equal efficacy and safety when compared with the longer needle (8 mm) and are suitable for all patients regardless of BMI. ● 8 mm needles should be discouraged to prevent the risk of intramuscular injection ii. Using a new needle each time may reduce the risk of needle breakage in the skin, clogging of the needle, inaccurate dosing and complications associated with using blunt needles (e.g. lipohypertrophy , abscess) 6. Priming the insulin pen i. Priming should be done when changing to new insulin cartridge/ prefilled pen and before each injection. ii. To prime, turn the dose selector to select 2 units and hold the insulin pen with the needle pointing up. iii. Tap the top of the pen gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. iv. Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter shows “0”. The “0” must line up with the dose pointer . A drop of insulin should be seen at the needle tip v. If you do not see a drop of insulin, repeat steps ii - iv. 7. Dial the correct dose – Check the dose indicator to ensure the correct dose is selected. 8. Identify proper injection site/rotation. ● For ease of self-injection, the abdomen and thighs are the two main recommended injection sites for adults. a. Abdomen – inject at any place between the bottom of the ribs and the pubic area, 3 fingers width away from the navel. b. Thighs – inject in the top and outer part of the thigh, between 5 fingers width away from the knee and 5 fingers width away from the groin. Avoid the inner thigh. c. Buttocks and flanks – Inject into the upper , outer area of the buttocks. This site can be very difficult to use for self-injection and may require another person for administration. d. Arm – inject at the back of the arm, between 4 fingers width away from the 205 shoulder and 4 fingers width away from the elbow . ● Injection site rotation within any quadrant or half should be done systematically with spacing of at least 1 cm apart from each injection to prevent repeat tissue trauma. ● Advise to rotate injection sites within the same part of the body , not to change the injection part of the body too frequently due to different absorption of insulin at different parts of the body . ● Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender , bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. 9. Inject the insulin on clean skin. i. Insert the needle into the skin at 90°. ● For extremely thin adults with diabetes (BMI <19), the proper injection technique is to use the 4 mm needle accompanied by the lifting of the skin fold when injecting to avoid the intramuscular injection ● Individuals who have to continue using ≥8 mm needles should always lift a skin fold and/or inject at 45 ⁰ to avoid intramuscular injections ii. Press the injection button until the figure in the dose window returns to 0. iii. Count to 10 slowly before withdrawing the needle from the skin iv. Counting past 10 may be necessary for higher insulin doses. This is to ensure full dose delivery and prevent insulin leakage 10. Disposal of used needle i. Recap the used insulin needle using the outer cap. ii. Always remove and safely discard the needle after each injection and store the pen without an injection needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage and inaccurate dosing. 11. Keep the insulin pen in its case at room temperature, away from heat and light",

Patients should be informed that experiencing discomfort is expected during the initial days of methadone titration. Detoxification: In general, methadone treatment is a long-term treatment, similar to other chronic conditions. However , for patients who wish to discontinue treatment, they should be referred to a doctor for appropriate assessment and intervention. i.
